# PredNet

This repository is a `Torch` implementation of the paper [Deep Predictive Coding Networks for Video Prediction and Unsupervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08104).
It needs MNIST dataset for training.

Folder description:
1. [train](train): Training the model
2. [visualize](visualize): Visulaize the predicted output alongwith different states of the saved model.
